-[] `x++`\
**Explanation**: The x++ is an example of the postfix increment operator, which increments the value of x after its current value is used.
-[] `--x`\
**Explanation**: The x++ is an example of the postfix increment operator, which increments the value of x after its current value is used.
-[] `x--`\
**Explanation**: The x++ is an example of the postfix increment operator, which increments the value of x after its current value is used.\
11.What is the result of the following code?

```
java
int x = 5;
int y = 2;
int result = x / y;
```

-[x] result is 2\

-[] result is 2.5\
**Explanation**:In integer division, the remainder is truncated, so 5 / 2 results in 2.
-[] result is 3\
**Explanation**:In integer division, the remainder is truncated, so 5 / 2 results in 2.
-[] Compilation error\
**Explanation**:In integer division, the remainder is truncated, so 5 / 2 results in 2.\

12.Given the code below, what will be the value of z?

```
